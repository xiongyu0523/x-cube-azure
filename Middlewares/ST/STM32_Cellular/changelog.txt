3.0.0
=====

+ Release integration date : May 25 th, 2019

+ ADDITIONAL CONTENT and FEATURES (onto V3.0.0 x-cube-cellular)
  - x-cube-cellular structuration into a ST Middleware
  - UDP client in LwIP modem mode
  - Cellular stop (modem switch off) for BSD-like compatibility
  - Features improvements
  - MISRA 2012, MCUAstyle and CodeSonar improvements

+ DEFINES (portability to x-cube-cloud)
  - define USE_MODEM_BG96 in the IDE (preprocessing) : modem selection by compilation switch.
  - define PARTIAL_HEAP_SIZE in the IDE (preprocessing) : dynamic memory setting from IDE
  - define USE_COM_PING to 1 : PING service is available through COM API
  - define USE_ECHO_CLIENT, USE_HTTP_CLIENT, USE_PING_CLIENT, USE_DC_EMUL, USE_DC_MEMS, USE_CMD_CONSOLE to 0 : remove test applications and console

+ FIXES
  - cellular_service_task.c : force 2G PS attachment at switch on whatever the network mode operator on the field
  - com_sockets_ip_modem.c : do not ignore IP @ with one of its byte being null (com_convert_IPString_to_sockaddr())
  - com_sockets_ip_modem.c : socket has a wrong error code on timeout (com_recv_ip_modem())
  - com_sockets_ip_modem.c : wrong endianness of the port number in UDP, modem socket mode (com_convert_IPString_to_sockaddr())

+ RUNNING RESTRICTIONS
  - working without statistics on sockets
  - boot menu is not available

+ KNOWN LIMITATIONS
  - UG96 HW flow control is by default activated and could lead sometimes to issues.
  - Shutdown for BSD-like compatibility of the cellular
